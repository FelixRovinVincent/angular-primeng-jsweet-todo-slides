= Slides for Full Stack Java with JSweet, Angular 2, PrimeNG, and JAX-RS

This is part of the sample application for the presentation "Full Stack Java with JSweet, Angular 2, PrimeNG, and JAX-RS",
originally given at JavaOne in September, 2016 by [Kito D. Mann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kitomann) from
[Virtua, Inc.](https://virtua.tech). It demonstrates how you can write an [Angular 2](https://angular.io) application with [PrimeNG](http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/) components using Java (courtesy of the
 [JSweet](http://jsweet.org) transpiler), and have it talk to a standard Java back-end using [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/).
